# Garbage_Classification_Graduation_Project
This project implements an intelligent robotic arm equipped with a camera for real-time garbage detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The system leverages a Raspberry Pi 5 for model deployment and coordinate processing, while an Arduino controls the servo motors of the robotic arm based on the detected object coordinates.
