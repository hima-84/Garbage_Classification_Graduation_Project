# Garbage_Classification_Graduation_Project
This project features an advanced robotic arm equipped with a camera for real-time garbage classification using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The system leverages a Raspberry Pi 5 for model deployment and coordinate processing, while an Arduino controls the servo motors of the robotic arm based on the detected object coordinates to precisely maneuver the arm, enabling automated waste collection in various environments.
